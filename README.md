# Passport-OpenID Connect

Forked from: [Passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) strategy for authenticating
with [OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect/). For purposes of adding and removing necessary pieces of logic pertaining to Accolade's use of this software.

This module lets you authenticate using OpenID Connect in your Node.js
applications.  By plugging into Passport, OpenID Connect authentication can be
easily and unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework that
supports [Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/)-style middleware,
including [Express](http://expressjs.com/).
